Welcome to my first TOP (The Odin Project) Project. Will update this at the end
of the project in form of a self-reflection

What I learned and accomplished while completing this project: 
1. The use of lists and image elements.
2. Making use of the strong element.
3. Linking my pages together and making use of templates.
4. Became more and more comfy with the git workflow
