<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Lasagna is a popular Italian dish made by layering flat pasta sheets with savory ingredients like tomato sauce, creamy béchamel sauce, and a filling of ground meat or vegetables. Topped with cheese and baked to perfection, it offers a comforting and satisfying blend of flavors and textures.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong> Wide, flat pasta sheets that form the layers of the dish.</li>
    <li><strong> meat:</strong> Commonly beef or sausage, cooked and seasoned with herbs and spices.</li>
    <li><strong> sauce:</strong> A rich and flavorful sauce made with tomatoes, onions, garlic, and various herbs.</li>
    <li> <strong>Béchamel sauce:</strong> A creamy white sauce made from butter, flour, and milk.</li>
    <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> Usually a combination of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese, grated or sliced for layering and topping.</li>
    <li><strong>Vegetables</strong> (optional): Various vegetables can be added to the filling or as additional layers, such as spinach, mushrooms, zucchini, or bell peppers.</li>
    <li><strong>Herbs and spices:</strong> Common additions include basil, oregano, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper.</li>
    <li><strong>Olive oil:</strong> Used for sautéing the meat and vegetables and for greasing the baking dish.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Set your oven to the recommended temperature, typically around 375°F (190°C).</li>
    <li><strong>Cook the noodles:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain the noodles and rinse them under cold water to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare the sauce:</strong> In a separate pan, cook the ground meat (if using) over medium heat until browned. Add diced onions and minced garlic, cooking until they become translucent. Pour in the tomato sauce and season with herbs, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
    <li><strong>Make the béchamel sauce:</strong> In a saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add flour and whisk continuously for a minute until well combined. Gradually pour in the milk, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Cook the sauce until it thickens and reaches a smooth consistency. Season with salt, pepper, and any desired herbs.</li>
    <li><strong>Layer the lasagna:</strong> Start with a thin layer of the meat sauce at the bottom of a greased baking dish. Add a layer of lasagna noodles on top, followed by a layer of the meat sauce, a drizzle of béchamel sauce, and a sprinkle of grated cheese. Repeat the layers until you use up all the ingredients, finishing with a layer of noodles topped with a generous amount of béchamel sauce and grated cheese.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake in the oven:</strong>Bake in the oven: Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and place it in the preheated oven. Bake for about 25-30 minutes, then remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
    <li><strong>Rest and serve:</strong> Allow the lasagna to rest for a few minutes after removing it from the oven to set. This will make it easier to cut into neat portions. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
